# Dialog Skipper

## Changelog
- 2.3: Lol oops, fixed auto skip not actually checking if autoskip is on or not. Also updated for an edge case where the player pawn doesnt exist.
- 2.2: Added a "Skip All Dialog" option that just skips everything rather than manually filtering what should be skipped.
- 2.1: Fixed issues with it not actually skipping some dialog.
- 2.0: Updated for new sdk, no longer skips player and enemy sounds, dialog autoskip can be toggled on or off via a keybind.
- 1.0: Initial release.
